# Project 3: Steganography
This project is about steganography. In this project, it generally focusing on two methods:
LSB and Neural Network. The data sets used for this project are Tiny ImageNet Visual
Recognition Challenge and Kodak Lossless True Color Image Suite.
How to run:  The code is based on the project, just click run, and it should show 
the iterations and optimized solution for both cauchy point and dogleg.

The algorithm implementations are from kelvins, gabrielilharco and
alexandremuzio. Both of those implementation are mentioned in the project description.
